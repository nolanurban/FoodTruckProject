# FoodTruckProject
 Second Weekend Homework Project

Highlights:

Utilizing OOP to create not only a food truck class but also a food truck tools class to break it down and interweave it into main.
I am fairly proud of the array work in combination with objects co-mingled from FoodTruck and FoodTruckTools.  Especially for the "returnOneLine()" method that helps cut out the need to iterate through an array and allows the programmer to go directly to the position they wish.

Build Thoughts:

I really focused on building the tools I would need before even thinking about putting a line of code in main.  This did bite me in one area since I didn't read the project design fully through and I had to modify the FoodTruck() method parameter by eliminating user input identification numbers for a static.

I decided not to offshore any of the loops or System.in because I thought it was unnecessary as the heart of the assignment is about OOP and using objects.

Future Add On:

Going through and limiting string input, checking data types, and ensuring sound programming will become a bigger part of my code from the beginning.  I think these are consistent programming habits which I'm still developing but I am happy that I am attacking the heart of the programming first.

I'd like to see this come to life in a GUI so I'm curious on what frameworks will help me establish that.
