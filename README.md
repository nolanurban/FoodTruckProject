# FoodTruckProject
 Second Weekend Homework Project

Day 1:

Completed creation of two major classes:

FoodTruck

FoodTruckTools

I will utilize these two objects to create not only the class for user input but also the tools to deal with it.

Additionally, within the main body I've created two loops to deal with two user menu choices.

Lastly, I need to assign a static ID that increments upon every new creation.
